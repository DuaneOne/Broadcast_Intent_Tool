# Broadcast_Intent_Tool
Broadcast Intent sender and receiver tuned to moohsimeter

If you have an Android version of the mooshimeter app which sends out its measured values via broadcast intents (such as my Mooshimeter-AndroidApp-34beta-BcastIntent app) then this tool will allow you to display what the meter measures.  You can view the app/src files to see how it is done.  Or you can simply sideload the tool app and run it.

The pop-ups will continue to run in background.   Also, it will broadcast one value (pi) with no units when the button is pressed.  So you can use it to test your own broadcast receiver for compatibility withthe mooshimeter.
